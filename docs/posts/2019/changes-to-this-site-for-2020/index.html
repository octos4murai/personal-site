<h1 id="post-title">Changes to this Site for 2020</h1>
<p id="post-date" class="gray-text">2019.12.02</p>

<p>It has been a long while since my last post. Since then, I have made a couple changes to this site. Here in this short post, I outline those changes.</p>
<h3>Containerization</h3>
<p>I’m not well-versed with Ruby or its surrounding technologies. Gems, Bundler — I have only a surface knowledge of these topics. The static site generator I use for this website is Jekyll, which is written in Ruby. To make changes to my site or run it locally in development, I needed to to have Ruby set up along with the related Gems (packages). And because I worked on my site so infrequently, I often had packages getting deprecated or had cryptic error messages to chase down whenever I wanted to do some small piece of work on my site.</p>
<p>To improve this situation, I wrote a simple Dockerfile for my project. I learned just enough Docker to get started and then proceeded to look at sample implementations online. I referenced existing Dockerfiles and worked to understand what every line meant. In the end, I was able to come out with the Docker image I currently use, built on top of Alpine Linux and of course Ruby. I wrote it to run Jekyll on top of that base — but specifically configured to work with GitHub Pages (which I use to host my site).</p>
<p>The docker image is here: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/alidian/github-pages">alidian/github-pages</a>. The Dockerfile used to generate it can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/octos4murai/octos4murai.github.io/blob/master/Dockerfile">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Domain Change</h3>
<p>Recently, I switched from my old domain <a href="http://idian.al">idian.al</a> to the current <a href="https://octos4murai.github.io">octos4murai.github.io</a>. From the beginning, this site has always been hosted on GitHub through the GitHub Pages feature, where GitHub uses a static site generator to build a site from scratch each time. This approach has many benefits, some of which I discuss in my post <a href="/posts/2016/jekyll-an-incomplete-overview">Jekyll: An Incomplete Overview</a>.</p>
<p>I switched from an apex domain to a generic GitHub subdomain because I recognized that it mostly does not matter to people if I use a GitHub subdomain. This is probably particularly true for anyone who might be interested to read my blog posts — probably developers themselves. Moreover, using a GitHub subdomain means I don’t need to do my own setup to use SSL; this comes free in the subdomain option.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest downside to this domain change is that any references to my old domain on search engines are now broken. After some consideration, I have decided that this is just fine.</p>
